# Approach 2: Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm

## Time complexity : 

O(n) Let us denote nnn as the total number of nodes in the linked list. To analyze its time complexity, we consider the following two cases separately.

List has no cycle:
The fast pointer reaches the end first and the run time depends on the list's length, which is O(n)O(n)O(n).

List has a cycle:
We break down the movement of the slow pointer into two steps, the non-cyclic part and the cyclic part:

The slow pointer takes "non-cyclic length" steps to enter the cycle. At this point, the fast pointer has already reached the cycle. Number of iterations=non-cyclic length=N\text{Number of iterations} = \text{non-cyclic length} = NNumber of iterations=non-cyclic length=N

Both pointers are now in the cycle. Consider two runners running in a cycle - the fast runner moves 2 steps while the slow runner moves 1 steps at a time. Since the speed difference is 1, it takes distance between the 2 runnersdifference of speed\dfrac{\text{distance between the 2 runners}}{\text{difference of speed}}
difference of speed
distance between the 2 runners
â€‹
loops for the fast runner to catch up with the slow runner. As the distance is at most "cyclic length K\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K" and the speed difference is 1, we conclude that
Number of iterations=almost\text{Number of iterations} = \text{almost}Number of iterations=almost "cyclic length K\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K".

Therefore, the worst case time complexity is O(N+K)O(N+K)O(N+K), which is O(n)O(n)O(n).

## Space complexity : O(1)

We only use two nodes (slow and fast) so the space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1).
