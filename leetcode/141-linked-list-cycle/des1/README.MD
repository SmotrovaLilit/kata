# Approach 1: Hash Table
Let nnn be the total number of nodes in the linked list.

# Time complexity : O(n)

We visit each of the nnn elements in the list at most once. Adding a node to the hash table costs only O(1)O(1)O(1) time.

# Space complexity: O(n)

The space depends on the number of elements added to the hash table, which contains at most nnn elements.
