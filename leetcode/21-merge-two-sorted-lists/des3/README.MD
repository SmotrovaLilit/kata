# Iteration

## Time complexity : 

O(n+m)

Because exactly one of l1 and l2 is incremented on each loop iteration, the while loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the sum of the lengths of the two lists. All other work is constant, so the overall complexity is linear.
## Space complexity : 

O(1)

The iterative approach only allocates a few pointers, so it has a constant overall memory footprint.
