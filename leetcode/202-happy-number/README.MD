## [1. Detect Cycles with a HashSet](des1)
**Time complexity**: O(log n)

**Space complexity**: O(log n)

## [2. Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm](des2)
**Time complexity**: O(log n)

**Space complexity**: O(1)

## [3. Hardcoding the Only Cycle (Advanced)](des3)
**Time complexity**: O(log n)

**Space complexity**: O(1)

## [4. @Manky  solution](des4)

This approach was based on the idea that all numbers either end at 1 or enter the cycle {4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20}, wrapping around it infinitely.
