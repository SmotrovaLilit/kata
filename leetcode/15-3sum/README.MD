# 3 sum

## [1. Two Pointers ](des3)
**Time complexity**: O(n*n)
**Space complexity**: O(n)

## [2. Hashset ](des4)
**Time complexity**: O(n*n)
**Space complexity**: O(n)

## [1. No sort ](des5)
**Time complexity**: O(n*n)
**Space complexity**: O(n)

While the asymptotic complexity is the same, this algorithm is noticeably slower than the previous approach. Lookups in a hashset, though requiring a constant time, are expensive compared to the direct memory access.
