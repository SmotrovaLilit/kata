# Two pointers

Given an array of integers numbers sorted in non-decreasing order and a target integer target, find two numbers in numbers such that they add up to target. Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed), where the first index is smaller than the second.

You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
